<h1>OH NOEZ! UR LYNKZ IZ BROKEN</h1>
<h2>TinyThom.as works only with search URLs from <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov">http://thomas.loc.gov</a>.</h2>
<p>If your link looks like "http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/thomas", that's not enough for TinyThom.as to go on; we need a URL with a "?" in it.</p>
<p>If you have a moment, you might <a href="">submit a bug report</a> to explain what happened so that we can try to fix it for you. :-)</p>
