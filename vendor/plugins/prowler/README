Prowler
=======

This is a plugin for integrating apps with the Prowl iPhone application.

INSTALLATION

From your project's RAILS_ROOT, run:

  script/plugin install git://github.com/pixeltrix/prowler.git

CONFIGURATION

You should have something like this in config/initializers/prowler.rb.

  Prowler.configure do |config|
    config.api_key = 'ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff'
    config.application = 'www.example.com'
  end

You can test that Prowler is working in your production environment by using
this rake task (from RAILS_ROOT):

  rake prowler:test

If everything is configured properly the task will send a request to
prowl.weks.net which will be appear on your iPhone after a short delay.

USAGE

To use Prowler within your application just call the notify method, e.g.

  Prowler.notify "Event", "Description", Prowler::Priority::NORMAL

If you need to send to multiple accounts from within a single application you
can create an instance of the Prowler class to override the global settings, e.g.

  prowler = Prowler.new('apikey', 'application')
  prowler.notify "Event", "Description", Prowler::Priority::NORMAL

If performance is a concern then there is built in support for Delayed::Job.
This can done either on a global basis, e.g.

  Prowler.configure do |config|
    config.delayed = true
  end

or on a individual message basis, e.g.

  Prowler.notify "Event", "Description", Prowler::Priority::NORMAL, true

ABOUT

Prowler relies upon the Prowl iPhone application which is advertised as
a Growl notification forwarder from your Mac. However they provide an API
which can be called by a generic script which allows you to use the
application as a general push notification application for your iPhone.
